Thought Process and Design Decisions

1. Understanding the Requirements
  The app needed to allow users to create, edit, delete, prioritize, and manage tasks effectively. Additionally, features such as reminders, notifications, task sorting, and searching were 
  identified as essential for enhancing user experience.

2. Choosing the Architecture
   To maintain a clean and scalable codebase, I opted to use the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern.

3. State Management
   Given the requirement to manage the state of tasks across the app, I chose to use the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern
   
5. Local Storage
   For storing tasks locally on the device, I opted to use the sqflite plugin.

6. User Interface Design
   The UI was designed following Material Design principles, ensuring a clean, intuitive, and responsive interface.
